# React SPA with DummyJSON API Integration

Welcome to the **React SPA with DummyJSON** repository! This project is a simple single-page application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) that fetches and displays data from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/). It serves as a starter template for those looking to learn and implement data fetching and state management in React.
